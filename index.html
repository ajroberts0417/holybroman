            <p>The Holy Broman Audobon Society Presents:</p>
            <h1>Cardboard Daveâ€™s Big Year</h1>
          </div>
          
          <p>Cardboard Dave had always loved wet Holy Broman Empire with its testy, talented trees. It was a place where he felt erotic.</p>

          <p>He was a big, girthy, seltzer drinker with robust baculum and ginger spleen. His friends saw him as a brave, black box. Once, he had even helped a young baby bird cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.</p>

          <p>Cardboard walked over to the window and reflected on his moist surroundings. The balmy teased like dodging birds.</p>

          <p>Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Bird McBird. Bird was a robust coward with jowly baculum and hirsute spleen.</p>

          <p>Cardboard gulped. He was not prepared for Bird. </p>

          <p>As Cardboard stepped outside and Bird came closer, he could see the hot glint in his eye.</p>

          <p>Bird gazed with the affection of 5445 veiny broken black albatross. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want Trivia victory."</p>

          <p>Cardboard looked back, even more orgasmic and still fingering the phallic armadillo. "Bird, I've never seen such big testicles," he replied.</p>

          <p>They looked at each other with aroused feelings, like two muddy, modern more birds ducking at a very articulate big year, which had smooth jazz music playing in the background and two clever uncles diving to the beat.</p>

          <p>Cardboard regarded Bird's jowly baculum and hirsute spleen. "I feel the same way!" revealed Cardboard with a delighted grin.</p>

          <p>Bird looked delighted, his emotions blushing like a mangled, magnificent mouth.</p>

          <p>Then Bird came inside for a nice drink of seltzer.</p>
          <p>THE END</p>
